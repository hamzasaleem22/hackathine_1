# Module 1: ROS 2 & Robotics Middleware

**Duration**: 3 weeks
**Status**: Coming Soon

## Overview

Module 1 introduces the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the industry-standard middleware for robotics development. You'll learn core architectural patterns, inter-process communication, and hands-on development with real robot simulation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand ROS 2 architecture and its advantages over ROS 1
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Implement publisher-subscriber communication patterns
- Use launch files for multi-node orchestration
- Debug and visualize ROS 2 systems with command-line tools
- Build a simple mobile robot controller in simulation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- ✅ Completed [Module 0: Introduction to Physical AI](../module-0/)
- Basic programming knowledge in Python or C++
- Familiarity with Linux terminal and package management
- Installed Docker (for containerized ROS 2 environment)

## Module Structure

This module is under development. Planned chapters include:

1. **ROS 2 Architecture & Core Concepts** - Nodes, executors, QoS policies, DDS middleware
2. **Publisher-Subscriber Pattern** - Creating topics, message types, custom messages
3. **Services and Actions** - Synchronous request-reply and long-running tasks
4. **Launch Files & Parameter Management** - YAML configs, composable nodes
5. **Visualization & Debugging Tools** - RViz2, rqt_graph, ros2 CLI commands

## Topics Covered

- ROS 2 Humble distribution and workspace setup
- Colcon build system
- Publisher-subscriber communication patterns
- Service-client interactions
- Action servers and clients
- Launch file creation (Python and XML)
- Parameter servers and dynamic reconfiguration
- TF2 coordinate frame transformations
- RViz2 visualization
- Integration with Gazebo simulation

## Estimated Time

- **Reading**: 12 hours
- **Hands-On Exercises**: 20 hours
- **Projects**: 10 hours
- **Total**: 42 hours (~3 weeks at 14 hours/week)
